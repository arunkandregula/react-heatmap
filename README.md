# HeatMap implemented using D3 and React
D3 Charts can be implemented in multiple approaches in React:
Approach 1. D3 handles DOM.
Approach 2. React handles the DOM taking advantage of virtual DOM.

Definitely Approach2 has more advantages than Approach1.

But for now, I have implemented Approach 1. When time permits, Ill implement Approach 2.

## Technologies used

- React
- D3
- ES6
- SASS
- HTML5
- Webpack
- Babel

## How to run the source code to see the application
1. Clone this repo:
git clone git@github.com:arunkandregula/react-heatmap.git
2. cd react-heatmap
3. npm install
4. npm run build
5. Wait until it says : webpack: Compiled successfully.
6. And then, open http://localhost:3333/ in browser.
