# HeatMap implemented using D3 and React
D3 Charts can be implemented in multiple approaches in React:
Approach 1. D3 handles DOM.
Approach 2. React handles the DOM taking advantage of virtual DOM.

Definitely Approach2 has more advantages than Approach1.

But for now, I have implemented Approach 1. When time permits, Ill implement Approach 2.

## Technologies used

- React
- D3
- ES6
- SASS
- HTML5
- Webpack
- Babel

1. Clone this repo:
git clone git@github.com:arunkandregula/react-heatmap.git

2. npm install
3. cd react-heatmap
4. npm install
5. npm run build
